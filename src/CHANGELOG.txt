added routing to pages for neil young playlist, joni mitchell playlist, a-list pop playlist, browse, default homepage, r&b now

organized assets files and files in src

GOALS BEFORE NEXT WEEK:
- edit category card component to be only one card and then input each image
- add headings into app.component.html instead of having them in the component html files
- edit routed pages (not sure if this needs to be a card or what so i just left it alone for now)
- styling to make it consistent throughout and more similar to the original site
