added text/images/a button to the listen now page to make it look like the original

added cards to playlist pages for neil young, joni mitchell, and a-list pop

GOALS BEFORE NEXT WEEK:
- 
- add headings into app.component.html instead of having them in the component html files
- edit routed pages (not sure if this needs to be a card or what so i just left it alone for now)
- styling to make it consistent throughout and more similar to the original site
